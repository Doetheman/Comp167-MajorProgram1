Directions for building the full application.
1. Copy/Download the MeteorBlasterDriver.zip and MeteorBlasterGUI2.jar files.
2. Unzip the MeteorBlasterDriver.zip project.
3. Open up the MeteorBlasterDriver application in NetBeans.
4. Right click Libraries, select Add Jar/Folder
5. Navigate to and select the MeteorBlasterGUI2.jar file.
6. Clean and Build your MeteorBlasterBackend project. My code is expecting
   the package name meteorblasterbackend (all lowercase). 
7. Right click Libraries in the MeteorBlasterDriver project again, select Add Jar/Folder
8. Select your meteorblasterbackend.jar file.
9. You should now have three libaries associated with the MeteorBlasterDriver project:
   JDK 1.8, meteorblasterGUI2, meteorblasterbackend
10. Set the working directory to the root of the MeteorBlasterDriver project directory.  It
    contains the images and config directories.
11. Add the command line arguments/parameters.  The MeteorBlasterDriver project is a JavaFX 
    project so setting the command line arguments is different. Go to the customize page as
    usual but click the Edit on the Parameters line. Click the add button and type 
    config/meteorBlasterConfig.txt in the Name text box.  Click add again and type
    config/gameData.txt in the Name box on the second line.
12.  Click OK on the customize window and run the project.
